---Creating a table 

CREATE Table appearances( 
	player_id INTEGER, 
	game_id INTEGER,
	appearance_id VARCHAR,
	competition_id VARCHAR,
	player_club_id INTEGER,
	goals VARCHAR,
	assists VARCHAR,
	minutes_played VARCHAR,
	yellow_cards VARCHAR,
	red_cards VARCHAR,
	date VARCHAR,
	player_pretty_name VARCHAR 
) 

---Changing the format to a coulmn

ALTER TABLE  appearances 
ALTER COLUMN goals TYPE INTEGER USING (goals::INTEGER)


---Who has scored the most goals?

SELECT player_pretty_name, SUM(goals) AS goals_scored
FROM appearances 
GROUP BY player_pretty_name 
ORDER BY SUM(goals) DESC


---Top 5 goal scores in the champions league?

SELECT player_pretty_name, SUM(goals) AS goals_scored
FROM appearances 
Where competition_id = 'CL'
GROUP BY player_pretty_name 
ORDER BY SUM(goals) DESC
LIMIT '5'


---Top 5 Highest goal scores in 2023?

SELECT player_pretty_name, SUM(goals) AS goals_scored
FROM appearances
where date  > '2022-01-01'
GROUP BY player_pretty_name 
ORDER BY SUM(goals) DESC


---Highest goals and assists ratio 

SELECT player_pretty_name, 
(SUM(goals) + SUM(assists))/ COUNT(minutes_played)
GROUP BY player_pretty_name 
ORDER BY (SUM(goals) + SUM(assists))/ COUNT(minutes_played) DESC
AS ga_ratio
FROM appearances


---Added the rest of the sheets into the database 

CREATE TABLE clubs(
    club_id INTEGER,
	name VARCHAR,
	pretty_name VARCHAR,
	domestic_competition_id VARCHAR,
	total_market_value INTEGER,
	squad_size INTEGER,
	average_age INTEGER,
	foreigners_number INTEGER,
	foreigners_percentage INTEGER,

	national_team_players INTEGER,
	stadium_name VARCHAR
)

---Joining two tables together 

SELECT * FROM appearances
INNER JOIN player
ON appearances.player_id = player.player_id
